Basics of Ansible
Module-1

We are using two OS, both redhat version-8


Control Node: Where we write code
Target Node:Where we configure. Also known as the Managed Node

Ansible is agentless, i.e, we install it on 1 OS and it is capable to work on other OS.

Commands to set up ansible:

On your Control Node:

1.pip3 install ansible
2. ansible all --list-hosts

Currently, there is no inventory, we shall create one.

3.vim ip.txt
192.168.43.144 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=shreya ansible_connection=ssh
(Write ip of your Target Node)


4. mkdir /etc/ansible
5. vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

[defaults]
inventory= /root/ip.txt

Control Node is ready.

Go to the target node and stop httpd command. Check its status to confirm if it is inactive.

In Control Node, 
dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm


6. ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

Go to the Target Node and check status of httpd, it would be active.
